Plate PHP
=======================================================
Plate PHP eliminates the boiler plate code of database queries. Plate was inspired by Django Models and Backbone Collections. 

<p><strong>Let's get setup.</strong></p>

1. Open ```config.php``` and make sure ```$config["db"]["mysql"]["on"]``` is set to true. Then input your database connection information. For the time being make sure Redis is set to False since this is not supported in the current release.

	```php
	$config = array();
	$config["db"]["mysql"]["on"] = True;//if using mysql;
	$config["db"]["redis"]["on"] = False;//if using redis;
		
  	if($config["db"]["mysql"] == True)
	{
		$config["db"]["mysql"]["host"] = "YOUR DATABASE HOST ADDRESS";
		$config["db"]["mysql"]["user"] = "DB USER NAME";
		$config["db"]["mysql"]["pass"] = "DB PASSWORD";
		$config["db"]["mysql"]["name"] = "DATABASE NAME";
	}
	if($config["db"]["redis"] == True)
	{
		$config["db"]["redis"]["host"] = "HOST ADDRESS";
		$config["db"]["redis"]["port"] = "PORT NUMBER";
			
	}
	```

2. Include ```plate.php``` in your code.
3. Include the static method ```Plate::Start()``` to initialize Plate PHP

<h2>Models</h2>

A Plate Models is the single source of your data. Every model should map to a single database table or document.

<h4>Defining your models</h4>
Let's create a model called ```Post```, which will represent a single blog post. In the model we'll define the data fields and database engine to use with this model, which in this case will be MySql. <em>Note that the name of a model must match the name of your database table and that all specified data fields must match table fields in your database.</em>

```php
<?php
include('plate.php');
Plate::Start();

class Post
{
	public function __construct()
	{
		/* Specify the data-fields this model will access. 
		These fields must match exactly to your database table fields */
		$data = array(
			'id',
			'title',
			'text',
			'user_name',
			'pub_date'
		);
		$meta = array(
			'dbType' => 'mysql' //set database engine to mysql
		);
		$this->setData($data);
		$this->setMetaData($meta);
	}

}
```

<h4>Fetch a Model</h4>

Now that the ```Post``` model has been defined let's fetch a single Blog Post using the ```fetch()``` method.

```php
	//Define our blog post object
	$post = new Post();
	
	//Let's get a blog post with an id of 1 using the filter method
	$singlePost = $post -> filter("id=1");
	$singlePost = $singlePost -> fetch();
	
	//You can also Chain the methods
	$singlePost = $post -> filter("id=1") -> fetch();
	
	//Select a blog post by username
	$singlePost = $post -> filter("user_name = 'foo@example.com') -> fetch();
```
```
	// fetch() will return a single key with your model's data
	print_r($singlePost);
	Array
	(
		[id] 			=> 		1
		[text] 			=> 		This is my first blog post, welcome to my blog...
		[title] 		=> 		My First Blog Post
		[user_name]		=>		foo@example.com
		[pub_date]		=>		2013-08-10 13:00
	)
```

If you need to fetch multiple rows of data or if there is the possibility for multi-rows of data(ex. fetching blog posts published after July 1st could potentially return multiple posts) create a collection and fetch the collection. Collections are explained after the Model section.
