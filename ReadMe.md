Plate PHP -- Why Query?
=======================================================
Plate PHP eliminates the boiler plate code of database queries. Plate was inspired by Django Models and Backbone Collections. Let's get setup.

1. Open ```config.php``` and make sure ```$config["db"]["mysql"]["on"]``` is set to true. Then input your database connection information. For the time being make sure Redis is set to False since this is not supported in the current release.

	```php
	$config = array();
	$config["db"]["mysql"]["on"] = True;//if using mysql;
	$config["db"]["redis"]["on"] = False;//if using redis;
		
  	if($config["db"]["mysql"] == True)
	{
		$config["db"]["mysql"]["host"] = "YOUR DATABASE HOST ADDRESS";
		$config["db"]["mysql"]["user"] = "DB USER NAME";
		$config["db"]["mysql"]["pass"] = "DB PASSWORD";
		$config["db"]["mysql"]["name"] = "DATABASE NAME";
	}
	if($config["db"]["redis"] == True)
	{
		$config["db"]["redis"]["host"] = "HOST ADDRESS";
		$config["db"]["redis"]["port"] = "PORT NUMBER";
			
	}
	```

2. Include ```plate.php``` in your code.
3. Include the static method ```Plate::Start()``` to initialize Plate PHP

<h2>Models</h2>

A Plate Models is the single source of your data. Every model should map to a single database table or document.

<h4>Defining your models</h4>
Let's create a model called ```Post```, which will represent a single blog post. In the model we'll define the data fields and database engine to use with this model, which in this case will be MySql. <em>Note that the name of a model must match the name of your database table and that all specified data fields must match table fields in your database.</em>

```php
<?php
include('plate.php');
Plate::Start();

class Post
{
	public function __construct()
	{
		/*Specify the data-fields this model will access. 
		These fields must match exactly to your database table fields*/
		$data = array(
			'id',
			'md5_id',
			'cid',
			'uid',
			'admin',
			'remove'
		);
		$meta = array(
			'dbType' => 'mysql' //set database engine to mysql
		);
		$this->setData($data);
		$this->setMetaData($meta);
	}

}
```

<h4>Accessing a Model</h4>

Now that are ```Post``` model has been defined let's play with it. Every Plate model has the following database query methods attached to it: ```fetch()```, ```save()``` and ```delete()```.

<p><strong>fetch()</strong></p>
Fetch is used to access your model's data. In the example below we'll use our ```Post``` model to go over options available with fetch, such as ```orderBy()``` and ```filter()```. 
```php
